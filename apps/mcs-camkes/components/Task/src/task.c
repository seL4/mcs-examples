/* This example demonstrates mixed-criticality scheduling:
 * Consider 3 threads with budget and period setting as T_1(90 / 200),
 * T_2(60 / 250), and T_3(10 / 300), sorted in descending order of priority.
 * The sum of CPU utilization is 72.3% thus meeting the schedulability
 * requirement of Rate-monotonic scheduling, which means the lower priority
 * thread T_3 will always have its chance to run.
 *
 * **Note**: This example works well with x86_64, but not with Arm64/32.
